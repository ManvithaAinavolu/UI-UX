# UI-UX Development 

# Overview
This repository contains my UI/UX design projects completed as part of an internship application.
The projects include redesigning a food website for mobile view and creating an icon for the "Find-Intern Area" feature of an Internshala clone website. 
Below are brief descriptions of each project along with my approach to solving them.

# Website Redesign Challenge
# Description:
For this project, I chose to redesign a food website focusing on optimizing its mobile view for improved usability and user experience.

# Purpose:
The purpose of this redesign was to address the challenges faced by users when accessing the website on mobile devices. 
The goal was to enhance navigation, streamline information architecture, and improve overall visual design to create a seamless browsing experience for mobile users.

#Approach:
Using Figma, I carefully analyzed the existing website layout and identified areas for improvement.
I then created wireframes and prototypes to explore different design solutions.
The final design incorporates a clean and intuitive layout, optimized for small screens, with improved navigation and visually appealing elements to engage users.

# App Icon Redesign
# Description:
For this project, I redesigned the icon for the "Find-Intern Area" feature of an Internshala clone website.

# Purpose:
The purpose of redesigning the app icon was to create a visually striking and memorable representation of the "Find-Intern Area" feature. The icon needed to be easily recognizable, aligning with the website's brand and functionality.

# Approach:
I began by researching design trends and studying the existing brand elements of the Internshala clone website. Based on this analysis, I created multiple icon variations, experimenting with shapes, colors, and symbols to convey the essence of the "Find-Intern Area" feature. The final design reflects the website's branding while standing out as a distinctive icon that captures the attention of users.
